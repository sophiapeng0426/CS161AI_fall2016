RSat 2.02 release notes and instructions
========================================
[Last modified 4/28/08]

RSat is licensed for only non-commercial, research or educational purposes only.
RSat's homepage is at http://reasoning.cs.ucla.edu/rsat
Please contact rsat@cs.ucla.edu if you have any question/comment/bug report.

This version of RSat can be run as a stand-alone program or with the SatELite preprocessor.
Please see the usage below.

The SatELite preprocessor is authored by Niklas Een.
The version of SatELite included in this package has been modified from its original version.
For the original source code of the preprocessor please visit 
http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Research/FormalMethods/MiniSat/SatELite.html

=========
 Changes 
=========

> v2.02 <

- Fixed Solaris incompatibility (log2(x) ==> log(x)/log(2), round(x) ==> floor(x+0.5)).
- Incremental SAT interface. In particular, the function add_base_clause can be used to add a clause into the knowledge base.
- Allow partial order to be specify. See po.txt for a sample partial order file. Use -h option to see the usage.
** Note that, currently, the partial order option cannot be used with the preprocessor. The preprocessor may change the indices of variables. Therefore, the use of partial order may result in unintended behavior.**

> v2.01, v2.00 <

- RSat command line option to print out solution. By default, RSat will not print out any solution.
- RSat command line option to not print out any answer line (for integration with preprocessor)
- RSat command line option to specify timeout.
- RSat command line option to print out useful stats during execution (verbose).
- New usage printing function (see --help option of RSat).
- Preprocessor command line option to print out solution. By default rsat.sh will not print out any solution.

**Additional features [added 6/21/07]
- Recursive SAT interface (see experimental_code.cpp)
- Example function for recursive SAT (rsat)
- Example function for model counting (count_models)

=========
Bug fixes (2.01)
=========
- memory bug in a learned clause deletion function. Would incorrectly allocate memory if the number of learned clauses at the time of the deletion is a power of 2. This would almost certainly cause the solver to crash on the instance.
- Memory leak fix. Close input file pointer. No memory leak--checked by valgrind.

===================
Notes to developers
===================

Please refer to code_structure.txt for an overview of the structure of the source code.

=========
Building
=========

To build (preprocessor and solver), run 

> ./build.sh

=====
Usage
=====

To run RSat with the preprocessor, run 

> ./rsat.sh <cnf-file>

To run RSat without the preprocessor, run

> ./rsat <cnf-file>

By default, both modes will output an answer line (SAT/UNSAT) but not the actual solution (if SAT).
To print out solution in either mode, run it with '-s'.

Run

> ./rsat.sh --help

or 

> ./rsat --help

for the list of options.
