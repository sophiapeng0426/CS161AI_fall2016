Problem 1:
*** question 1 ***
	see complete network in test.net

*** question 2 ***
	Pr(D) >= 0.008942 or
	False Positive: Pr(T = Pos|D = No) <= 0.002219
	Change only False Negative is insufficient to ensure that Pr(D|T) >= 0.3 

Problem 2:
	(a) Variables and values:
		ExpectingGuests: Yes/No
		FamilyHome: Yes/No
		SoundSensor: On/Off
		LightSensor: On/Off
		HearableBarking: Yes/No
		Battery: On/Dead
		SoundSensorHealth: OK/Broken
		LightSensorHealth: OK/Broken
		DogBarking: Yes/No
		DogOutside: Yes/No
		OutdoorLight: On/Off
		DogBowelTrouble: Yes/No
	(b) The causal structure in the network are copied here:
		FamilyHome -> OutdoorLight
		FamilyHome -> DogOutside
		ExpectingGuests -> OutdoorLight
		DogBowelTrouble -> DogOutside
		OutdoorLight -> LightSensor
		LightSensorHealth -> LightSensor
		Battery -> LightSensor
		Battery -> SoundSensor
		DogOutside -> HearableBarking
		DogBarking -> HearableBarking
		HearableBarking -> SoundSensor
		SoundSensorHealth -> SoundSensor
	(c) The learned network is in Sambot.net using uniform parameter initialization and max 5 iterations. 

*** question 1 ***
	The most likely instantiations of all variables are:
	Battery	OK
	DogBarking	No
	DogBowelTrouble	Yes
	DogOutside	Yes
	ExpectingGuests	No
	FamilyHome	No
	HearableBarking	No
	LightSensorHealth	OK
	OutdoorLight	On
	SoundSensorHealth	OK

	The most likely instantiation of all variables are obtained by first learn the network (step b) and do MPE inference on the learned network given the envidence that LightSensor = On and SoundSensor = Off.

*** question 2 ***
	The most likely instantiations of sensors are:
	LightSensor	Off
	SoundSensor	Off

	The result is obtained by first giving the envidence of FamilyHome = Yes and ExpectingGuests = No, and do MAP inference on the learned network obtained by EM algorithm.

*** question 3 ***
	The smallest set is of size 2:
	SET = {Battery, X} where X in {OutdoorLight, FamilyHome, DogOutside, HearableBarking}

	The first path, LightSensor-Battery-SoundSensor is divergent and blocked since Battery is in SET.
	The second path, LightSensor-OutdoorLight-FamilyHome-DogOutside-DogBarking-SoundSensor consists of sequential, convergent, sequential, sequential and all blocked since they are in SET. Any of them in SET means the whole path is blocked.
	Therefore, all paths from LightSensor to SoundSensor are blocked and they are d-seperated, i.e., indenpendent given SET.

*** question 4 ***
	The network constructed is multiply-connected since it has loop.
